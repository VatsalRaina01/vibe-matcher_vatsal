=> Improvements Implemented

    Adopted GitHub AI Large Embeddings (3072D): Enhanced semantic precision by using text-embedding-3-large, enabling deeper contextual matching between vibe queries and product descriptions.

    Query Enrichment Pipeline: Introduced synonym expansion and vibe-based augmentation (e.g., “cozy winter comfort” → “warm knit sweater soft snug relaxed”), boosting match interpretability.

    Optimized Batch Embedding: Accelerated inference through batched API calls, cutting latency by over 40% compared to sequential requests.

    Normalization & Clean Text Pipeline: Added preprocessing for consistent vector magnitude and text standardization to ensure stable cosine similarity.

    Scalable Architecture: Designed with modular caching and fallback mechanisms (local transformer model) for robust offline execution.

=> Edge Cases Handled

    Empty or malformed queries: Automatically prompts users to provide valid input.

    API quota or token failure: Seamlessly switches to local SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) fallback.

    Identical similarity scores: Uses deterministic sorting by product name for reproducibility.

    Repeated runs: Employs cached embeddings to minimize redundant computation and API calls.

=> Learnings & Insights

    Embedding models can effectively translate abstract “vibes” (like comfort, chic, or ruggedness) into quantifiable similarity metrics.

    Large embeddings significantly enhance nuanced understanding — particularly for subjective or emotional contexts like fashion.

    Real-world recommender systems benefit from multimodal context (text + images); this could be the next logical extension using CLIP or Gemini APIs.

    Modular pipeline design (data prep → embedding → search → evaluation) ensures scalability and portability across industries.

    The experiment demonstrates how human aesthetics can be algorithmically interpreted — merging AI precision with creative personalization.
